<h3>Maintenance Services</h3>
<p>Maintenance Services are delivered annually as the Wildfire season begins and are designed to maintain the property in the insurer's "accepted state" for the duration of the coverage period. The Maintenance Services (collectively the "Maintenance Services") consist of a Property Inspection, any necessary minor structure repairs to prevent ember penetration, remediation of any debris on the roof, gutters or in the home ignition zones and any vegetation trimming or treatment needed to maintain the property in the accepted state (typically in the home ignition zone 0-5 feet from the structure) and in compliance with the Western States Wildfire Maintenance Standards. Maintenance Standards may change from time to time, for the current Standard visit: https://westernstateswilldfire.com/maintenancestandard.</h3> <h3>Delivery of the Maintenance Services is triggered by environmental conditions that indicate the upcoming start of the wildfire season. The Western States platform tracks ground condition data including NDVI (normalized Difference Vegetation Index), moisture levels, etc and infers then current vegetative growth stage based on historical and forecasted weather trends. The scheduling process is triggered when the NDVI is forecasted to drop below a defined threshold that indicates the seasonal growth stage has ended.</h3> <h3>High Fire Risk Inspection and Maintenance Service ("HFRS") The High Fire Risk Inspection and Maintenance Service includes a property owner alert and on-site inspection of the property. Any property conditions that vary from the "Accepted State" (as defined in the Inspection Report) are documented and remediations are implemented on the spot, if possible, via the Managed Service Standard. The HFRS Service is triggered when the monitoring platform records a regional hot, dry, windy weather forecast and the Local Fire</p> <p>Danger index and the Property Level Average Moisture are collectively in the 95th percentile. This combination provides predictive indication of potential wildfire starts over a projected 24-72 hour period.</p> <h3>Post Fire Inspection Service ("PFS")</h3> <p>The Post Fire Risk Inspection Service is delivered post-fire to properties within the fire footprint or within ten miles of the final fire footprint. The Inspection will document conditions at the property, review any smoke damage, and facilitate the procurement of any Clean Up Services to secure the property, monitor indoor air quality, remove fire debris, test for toxins, sample soil, etc. For the avoidance of doubt, Clean Up Services and any reimbursement for Smoke Damage are not included in the Maintenance Plan but may be covered by the Customer's policy.</p>
